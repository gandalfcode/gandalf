freefall, both with and without hydro
boss-bodenheimer (tests hydro+gravity+sinks)
khi (pure hydro test)

all of this on c2pap, 1-16 cores openMP only, and then up to 64 or even 128 cores with MPI only and hybrid
we do two kinds of tests:
1)keep the same problem size and change the number of cores
2)keep the number of cores fixed and change the problem size
